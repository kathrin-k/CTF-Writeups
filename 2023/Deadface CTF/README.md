# Deadface CTF 2023

![](images/Deadface.png)

Deadface CTF 2023 was a very enjoyable and story-driven CTF.

The challenges were interconnected and used the same characters from a fictitious hacker group called "Deadface". There was a forum called "Ghost Town", where those fictitious hackers communicated. This could be used for some hints.

We, as CTF players, are part of the group "Turbo Tactical", which is supposed to investigate the hacker group Deadface and try to take them down.
